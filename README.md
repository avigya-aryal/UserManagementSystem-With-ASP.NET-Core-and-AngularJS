The user management system has been developed as the primary goal of the internship project. The given application contains the following 8 entities:

1.	Contact
2.	Employee
3.	Department
4.	Employee Schedule
5.	Leave Log
6.	Project
7.	User
8.	User Role

The main objectives of this application were:

•	To learn about onion architecture, an architectural pattern based on the inversion of control.
•	To learn about Inversion of Control and how it can be achieved with the help of Dependency Injection.
•	To learn Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), such as Dapper.
•	To learn Language-Integrated Query (LINQ).
•	To learn to develop API’s and connect the back-end with the front-end.


Research papers, templates, and samples were provided for the front-end part as the main focus was to learn the backend. In addition, the seniors also assisted us while doing the front end. I would like to mention that I have not done the front-end part except some styling and designing of the pages and authentication, which was handled by my teammate. The initial scope of the project was:

•	To perform CRUD operations on all these entities respectively.


As the goal was achieved in favor of time, the scope of the project was increased and the rest of the features were added to it, such as:

•	A person’s image could be added when registering his contact. Similarly, in the employee model, the employee’s citizenship could be added.
•	A search bar was added with filters where the user could search for an employee with filters such as first name or designation.
•	A basic form of authentication was added to the project.
